## About

A Frontend assesment project.

## Running locally in development mode

To get started, just clone the repository and run `npm install && npm run dev`:

    git clone https://github.com/Christopher-Cudiamat/frontend-assessment.git
    npm install
    npm run dev

## `npm run lint`

This command is used to run a code linter (e.g., ESLint) on your JavaScript or TypeScript codebase.
Thi linter checks your code for style and formatting issues, as well as potential programming errors.
When you run npm run lint, the linter will report any issues it finds in your code, but it won't automatically fix them.
It identifies and report problems, so you can manually address them.

## `npm run lint`

This command runs the code linter in a "fix" mode.

## `npm run format:fix`

This formats the code using the Prettier code formatter.
